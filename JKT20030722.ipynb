In case of only one chip, just merge the headers together and put it all in a single HDU. The following piece of code just does a loop over all images in the working folder, opens them, determines if there is only one chip, in which case, finds the main header, adds it to the chip header, removes the main header and saves the file.

More in detail, we have selected the pixels that are within $7.5 MAD$ of the median, which if the distribution was Gaussian would equate to a $5\\sigma$ clipping. This is not a severe constraint, and will get rid of most of the pixels belonging to galaxies and stars. If there is a mask for the image, the name of the mask should be in the header, and the key for that mask should be passed using the '--mask_key' option. Another option, the '--plot' would be useful to see the actual final fits to the sky, where hopefully you will see how nicely represented the sky is by a Gaussian.     "

The measured seeings from the header will help sort the images and decide which one to use as a reference, but at the end of the day, a full model of the PSFs of both images is performed using IRAF's PSF and PSFMatch. \n",

How much is \"close enough\"? If you have used estimate_seeing.py as I did above, you should have in your images a seeing_MAD keyword that tells you the median absolute deviation of the PSFs of the individual stars in the image. If your images are anything like mine, you'll see that value is between 0.2 and 0.5 pixels or so. That means that the median deviation within stars of the same image is in that range. Well, 0.2 is the limit below which no psf matching is done, but that can be changed using --limit in call to match_psfs.py below. \n",

    "So far we have both the narrow and broad band images combined. We now want to subtract the continuum, as measured from the broad image, from the narrow one. This is usually done by scaling the broad-band image to the image with the H$\\alpha$ filter by measuring the flux of the stars in both filters and calculating the ratio needed for them to coincide. The way of reasoning behind this is that the stars have mostly continuum emission. Then, the ratio between the two filters will give us a scaling factor. "

    "We can visually see how the proportion of the light of bd+284211 that falls within the narrow filter will be much smaller than the one for hiltner102, since one is decaying while the other is ascending with wavelength. The proportion of light within the narrow filter will mostly depend on the transmittance of the filters, and on their width, but the exact shape of the continuum will affect the ratio too, as we see here. \n",
    "\n",
    "A possible solution to this problem is to look for stars within the image that have similar colours to the galaxy, for example, as seen from Sloan. Assuming the contribution of the lines to the broad filters is small (which most likely it is, even for Starbursts the contribution of H$\\alpha$ is ~10%), the slope of the continuum will be well represented by, for example, $g-r$  or  $r-i$ and can be better represented with stars of the same slope.

    "Despite the concerns above, there is little we can do when our galaxies are not in an optical survey, such as SDSS. Of the three CIGs in tonight's sample, CIG 1047, 847 and 879, only 1047 is in Sloan, but we only have 1 Halpha image on this galaxy (just after that, on the log, there is observations of a supernova). 847 and 879 are not observed in the red part of the optical according to NED, so we will have to scale using the average of all the stars in the field, since it is impossible to select stars that are similar in continuum to the average colour of the galaxy.

    "We will do photometry stars in both the broad and narrow band images, and calculate the factor by which we will multiply the broad-band flux of the stars to get the factor by which it need to be multiplied to equate the narrow-band flux. We will use the program scale_images.py. In this case, the image of Halpha is the one we want as a reference, which means we want to scale the image with the brightest objects to the one with the faintest ones, exactly the contrary to what we would do in the case, for example, that we were scaling to the image with the smallest airmass in a photometric night, in which case we would want to scale to the brightest object!
